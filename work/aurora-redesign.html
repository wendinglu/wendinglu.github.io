<h3 class="full-center">Aurora is the premier platform for design and simulation for solar installers. I led a redesign to make it more intuitive, modern, and better serve the workflow of solar salespeople.</h3>

<h3>User Research</h3>
  <div class="pd">
    <p>
      A PM and I scheduled and conducted over 15 interviews and contextual inquiries with solar installers who were not already users. In these meetings, we asked and observed how they would prepare a solar system to sell to customers (their unit task).

  <h4>Personas</h4>
  <p>
    Two distinct personas emerged: the salesperson and the technical designer. While their job responsibilities seem similar, their priorities and approaches were very different. The conflation of these personas was the root cause of trouble in Aurora’s app, which mostly mapped well to the expectations of the technical designer but was too rigid and required too many inputs for the salesperson.
  </p>

  <h4>
    The Salesperson
  </h4>
  <p>
    Salespeople viewed their personality and presence as being key to educating customers and closing deals. They cared most about monopolizing a customer’s attention, which meant getting a foot in the door before competitors, impressing them, gaining their trust in person, and closing the deal promptly. As such, they would create their designs very quickly.
  </p>
  <h4>
    The Technical Designer
  </h4>
  <p>
    They wanted to create accurate, detailed systems and criticized competitors who weren't as diligent. While they sometimes took on sales roles too at smaller companies, they typically worked as production people at larger companies to create designs to hand off to other salespeople.

<h3>Concepts and Wireframe Testing</h3>

  <p>
    We revamped the layout and navigation to focus on a single design funnel. We also simplified the information architecture based on how users talked about their steps.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also saw a big opportunity for innovation with smart automation and defaults, using the project coordinates to connect with utility APIs, using our computer vision abilities to create base house models, and integrating with financing partners to initiate the application process in-app.
  </p>

<h3>Final Design</h3>
<div class="pd">
 <p>
    The Hi-Fi redesign included surveying every component and function of the app and creating a brand new design system.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recruited many of the users we initially tested the lo-fi mocks with, as well as some new users to complete tasks using a Sketch and Invision prototypes of the hi-fi mocks. We received overwhelming market confirmation by asking if users would be willing to put down a down-payment today for access to a Beta release of this product—an offer that nearly 100% of users tested committed to.
